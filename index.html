                        <h4>Boot Camp</h4>
                        <p>These classes are rooted in military-style training, so are typically pretty tough, and they
                            often include a combination of cardio and strength exercises. “Boot camp programs are
                            designed
                            to build strength and fitness through a variety of intense group intervals</p>

                        <h4>Circuit Training </h4>
                        <p>Think of this as a “round” of exercises. For example, in this bodyweight circuit workout, one
                            circuit consists of 5 burpees, 10 push-ups, 15 plank jacks, and 20 jump squats. “You are
                            moving
                            from one exercise right to the next with [minimal] rest in between each exercise</p>

                        <h4>Compound Exercise</h4>
                        <p>A compound exercise is a move that incorporates multiple muscle groups, like lunges,
                            deadlifts,
                            and squats. It may also refer to two moves being strung together, like a bicep curl to a
                            shoulder press</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Cool-Down</h4>
                        <p>This is what you do at the end of your workout. The goal is to gradually bring your body back
                            to
                            a resting state by lowering your heart rate and calming your nervous system. This is
                            typically
                            done with lighter movements and passive stretches</p>

                    <div class="item">
                        <h4>Cross-Training</h4>
                        <p>Cross-training means mixing in different workouts and training methods rather than focusing
                            on
                            just one type of workout. Not only does this help create a well-balanced fitness plan, but
                            it
                            can help you reach specific goals, too.</p>

                        <h4>DOMS</h4>
                        <p>DOMS stands for delayed onset muscle soreness, which is the soreness you feel the day or two
                            after a hard workout. This happens because when you’re working out you’re damaging muscle
                            fibers
                            (that’s a good thing!). </p>

                        <h4>Dynamic Warm-Up</h4>
                        <p>This is what you should be doing before exercise to raise your heart rate and body
                            temperature in
                            preparation for the workout. During this type of warm-up, you moving through stretches and
                            light
                            exercises without stopping </p>

                        <p>This generally refers to exercises that help you move and feel better in every day life,”
                            .These exercises often mimic the ways you move outside of the gym—for example, you’d use
                            many of the same muscle groups to perform a squat as you would to crouch down and tie your
                            shoe.</p>

                        <h4>Heart Rate Zones</h4>
                        <p>Your heart rate refers to how many beats per minute (BPM) your heart is pumping, and when it
                            comes to working out, knowing your heart rate can help determine if you’re working at the
                            right intensity.</p>

                        <p>HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. “This refers to tough quick, intense bursts
                            of exercise, followed by short recovery periods. This type of training gets and keeps your
                            heart rate up,” while also (typically) decreasing the overall amount of time you spend
                            training.</p>

                    <div class="item">
                        <h4>Interval Training</h4>
                        <p>An interval is simply a period of activity or a period of rest. While this often refers to
                            HIIT workouts, you can implement intervals in pretty much any workout. Maybe that’s 30
                            seconds of work and 15 seconds of rest, or 15 minutes of work and 2 minutes of rest—it
                            depends on what you’re doing and what your goals are.</p>

                        <h4> Isometrics</h4>
                        <p>Isometric exercises are where you hold a position under tension and just stay in that
                            position for a set amount of time,” .Think wall sits and planks. “They are a great way to
                            build stability and strength. And holding a position that is uncomfortable can help build
                            mental strength so you can even push harder during your workouts</p>

                        <h4>Plyometrics</h4>
                        <p>It’s not an exact science, but when you hear the term plyometric, you can go ahead and think
                            jumping and breathlessness. Examples would include squat jumps, box jumps, broad jumps, and
                            burpees. One of the main purposes of these explosive exercises is increasing power.</p>

                        <h4>Reps</h4>
                        <p>Shorthand for repetitions. Saying 12 reps means doing an exercise 12 times.</p>

                        <h4>Resistance</h4>
                        <p>Resistance means how much weight your muscles are working against to complete a movement.
                            That can mean anywhere from your own bodyweight to a set of five-pound dumbbells to a
                            50-pound kettlebell.

                        <p>This stands for rate of perceived exertion, and refers to intensity. It’s a point of
                            reference that trainers often use to communicate how hard you should be working since what
                            feels easy or challenging is different for everyone</p>

                        <h4>Sets</h4>
                        <p>A set refers to how many times you repeat a given number of reps. For example, one set might
                            be 12 reps of push-ups—repeating for three sets means you’ll do that three times through.

                        <p>Steady-state cardio refers to exercise where you aim to keep a set pace at a moderate
                            intensity, like a long run or bike ride. This type of endurance training is especially
                            beneficial if you’re training for a race or event.

                        <p>Strength training means using resistance to work your muscles; that can be your bodyweight,
                            dumbbells, kettlebells, sand bags, resistance bands, etc. The goal of this type of workout
                            is to increase muscle mass. Getting stronger helps improve everyday performance </p>

                        <h4>Super Set</h4>
                        <p>Super setting means pairing two exercises and doing them back-to-back. There are a few ways
                            to do these: You could save time by working two different muscle groups (like arms and legs)
                            so you don’t need to rest in between exercises, because one muscle group is recovering while
                            the other is working.</p>

                            effort followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated eight times for four minutes total. It’s
                            known for it’s insane fat-burning power.
